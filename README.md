# programming-challenges

These are my solutions to some of the challenges that are provided on different sites like [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/), and [Codeeval](https://www.codeeval.com/). The challenges are located in their corresponding `/<site_name>` directory.

The languages I currently work on with the challenges are:

* `Python`
* `Javascript`
* `Java`
* `Go`

You are welcome to make any suggestions (I'm no expert) and to use my code to help you better understand pretty much whatever the content is related to.
