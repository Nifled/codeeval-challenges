# codeeval-challenges

  These are my versions of the challenges that are provided on [Codeeval](https://www.codeeval.com/open_challenges/). The challenges are located in /src directory.

  The languages I currently work on with the challenges are:

  	Python
  	Java
  
  You are welcome to make any suggestions (as I'm not an expert) and to use my code to help you better understand pretty much whatever the content is related to. 

  NOTE: All the code that is pushed to this repo is NOT in the test-case/input format that CodeEval accepts. This is to make it easier to read.
