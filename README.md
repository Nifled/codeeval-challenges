# codeeval-challenges

  These are my versions of the challenges that are provided on [Codeeval](https://www.codeeval.com/open_challenges/). This being currently on Java, but might go into doing other fun stuff on here too.
  
  You are welcome to make any suggestions (as I'm not an expert) and to use my code to help you better understand pretty much whatever the content is related to. 

  NOTE: All the code that is pushed to this repo is NOT in the test-case/input format that CodeEval accepts. This is to make it easier to read.
