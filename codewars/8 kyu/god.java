According to the creation myths of the Abrahamic religions, Adam 
and Eva were the first Humans to wander the earth.

You have to do Godâ€™s job. The creation method must return an array 
of length 2 containing objects representing Adam and Eva. The 
first object in the array should be an instance of the class Man. 
The second should be an instance of the class Woman. Both objects 
have to be subclasses of Human. Your job is to implement the Human,
Man and Woman classes.
